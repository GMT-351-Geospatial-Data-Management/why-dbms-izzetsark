why we need a DBMS instead of a spreedshate ?
==>Because databases store information more efficiently, databases can handle volumes of information that would be unmanageable in a spreadsheet. 
Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not.
When a spreadsheet has many fields or a large amount of data (1000s of rows), the spreadsheet can be hard to read.
