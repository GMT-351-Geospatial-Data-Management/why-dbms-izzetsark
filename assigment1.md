why we need a DBMS instead of a spreedshate ?
==> Because databases store information more efficiently, databases can handle volumes of information that would be unmanageable in a spreadsheet. 
Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not.
When a spreadsheet has many fields or a large amount of data (1000s of rows), the spreadsheet can be hard to read.

What kind of spatial and thematic data you store?
==> We, as survey engineers, use many layouts and digitized maps in our work. Also, orthophotos are a product of our work, so we have to use and store them.
