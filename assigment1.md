why we need a DBMS instead of a spreedshate ?
==> Because databases store information more efficiently, databases can handle volumes of information that would be unmanageable in a spreadsheet. 
Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not.
When a spreadsheet has many fields or a large amount of data (1000s of rows), the spreadsheet can be hard to read.

What kind of spatial and thematic data you store?
==> We, as survey engineers, use many layouts and digitized maps in our work. Also, orthophotos are a product of our work, so we have to use and store them.

Do you use a DBMS? 
==> no we are use spreadsheet.

Do you instead store your data in spreadsheets ?
==> yes

Why do you think the use of spreadsheets is important? What is the main benefit to your operation?
==> First of all, it is clear that database management systems are more efficient than spreadsheets. However, it is necessary to know to use these systems. We are a small mapping office and we do not do business that requires us to use a database management system.

What do you think is the main source of trouble in using spreadsheets? 
==> Spreadsheets are convenient for managing and using small data, but if we are working with larger data, saving and managing them becomes more difficult. At this stage , it would be more beneficial to use database management systems .
